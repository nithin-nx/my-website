      <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>
      This website is a manually designed and developed static webpage created as part of my college project on web design and front-end development. The aim of this project was to redesign a simple, clean, and responsive website without using any AI-generated tools or templates. Every section of this site has been carefully structured using only HTML and CSS, ensuring full control over layout, responsiveness, and functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The website includes a visually engaging hero section with a call-to-action, followed by an informative about section describing the purpose of the project. A custom-built image gallery is implemented using real images I uploaded and hosted on GitHub, ensuring that the images load correctly and represent content that is personal and manually curated. There's also a video section that embeds a YouTube video to demonstrate how multimedia content can be embedded into static websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, a contact form is added to show how user input sections can be integrated into a webpage. While this form is static and does not currently process data, it showcases front-end form design using only HTML and CSS. The site is also responsive and mobile-friendly, ensuring it looks good on various screen sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project helped me better understand the structure and flow of front-end development. It also allowed me to explore how to host images on GitHub and integrate them into my web projects. Most importantly, it proves that professional-looking websites can be built from scratch with basic technologies and a clean, well-organized codebase â€” without the use of AI or automated site generators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, this project demonstrates a complete hands-on approach to website creation and fulfills the academic requirement of redesigning a simple website while showcasing real-world skills in HTML, CSS, and web hosting practices.
